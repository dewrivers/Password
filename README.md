This Password Generator is part of my task as a programmer, I used 3 programming languages, and many hours of work and learning, I had fun doing it and found new ways to improve, I like to perfect the details and I think that is where I take the most time.
If you need a new password, this can help you, and you don't have to spend your time and energy thinking and trying to remember all the time what password you can put.
okay..
The rules of this application are:

When you press the generate password button
The machine will ask you to select between numbers, symbols, lowercase and capitals, which of these options would you like your new password to have.
once selected that you would like the machine concatenates your number of characters and options to give you a fast and secure password, it will give you between more or less 88 possible combinations.
